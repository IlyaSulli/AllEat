# All Eat
A Food delivery app

## About the project
All Eat is a food delivery app developed as part of the A-Level OCR course. Development started from March 2022 to February 2023 with many iterations being completed. (Check https://github.com/IlyaSulli/AllEat/releases for the latest update). Although the app was never developed for the general market, it was designed to have the potential to have little work needed in order to get it on app stores. The app uses Flutter (using Dart) to build an Android application and was developed by a single developer.

## Common Issues
- **The app fails to login/create an account** - It is likely that by the time you try to use the app the servers have been pulled down but if you want to have it working, you can use the code from the final code to save a copy to a server and edit the code to go to your URL instead of the previous URLs
